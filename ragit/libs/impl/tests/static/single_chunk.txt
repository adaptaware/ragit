We calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the
geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are
purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. We define ARPU as our
total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the
average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the
quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in
this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in
the definition of MAU above. While the share of revenue from users who are not
also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate that revenue
from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantial
majority of our total revenue. See "Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)" above
for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our Family products. The
geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we
currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates.
Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are
relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and
mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2023 in the United States &
Canada region was more than 11 times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.
